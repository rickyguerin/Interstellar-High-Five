# Interstellar-High-Five
This game was made for [Godot Wild Jam #21](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-21/rate/646933).

Race against the clock to perform a high five using two giant robot arms. Each arm is operated using only one key (F and J respectively) but every few seconds, the mode of operation may switch between HOLD, MASH, and RELEASE, so pay attention! This game is intended for two players, but if you're feeling daring, you can attempt to high five yourself.
